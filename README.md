## **Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?**

This project is part of the *Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate* course as a Capstone Project.


**SCENARIO**

Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

The director of marketing (Moreno) believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

Moreno has assigned me to answer the question: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**


**CONCLUSION**

According to the data casuals take less rides but the average duration of the rides are way higher then the members. 
Maybe this is a trend among the members that might commute to work or school and casual users take longer sporadic trips.
